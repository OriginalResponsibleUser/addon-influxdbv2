# Home Assistant Community Add-on: InfluxDB v2

Scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics.

## About

InfluxDB is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction and is
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.

Compared to InfluxDB v1, v2 comes with a graphical administration interface which
gives you management capabilities of users, databases,
data retention settings, and lets you peek inside the database using the
Data Explorer.

## Known issues and limitations

- No SSL.
- This InfluxDB v2 addon currently does not support Home Assistant web access, in other terms the ingress. Reason is that InfluxDB v2 does not support path-based reverse proxies, leading to technical challenges.

## FAQ

### Migrating from InfluxDB v1 to v2 (intermediate difficult level)

To migrate from InfluxDB (hass community addon), easiest is to use [Advanced SSH & Web Terminal
](https://home.danieloldberg.se/hassio/addon/a0d7b954_ssh/info) addon with Protection mode disabled. You're then able to execute docker commands with elevated permissions.

**Please note**: Using the following mentioned methods may impact and/or destroy your entire Home Assistant installation if you don't know what you're doing. Please take appropriate precautions like backups and reading up on the machanics before proceeding.

```bash
docker ps -a # Descibe the containers running and finding the Ids.
docker exec -it {{ addon_xxxxx_influxdb }} /bin/bash # Enter the v1 container. Replace addon_xxxxx_influxdb with the v1 Id
influx_inspect export -database homeassistant -retention autogen -out /data/exports/influxdb -lponly -datadir /data/influxb -waldir /data/influxdb/wal # Export the influxdb timeseries data
exit # Exit container to host
docker cp {{ addon_xxxxx_influxdb }}:/data/exports/influxdb /root/ # Copy the backup to host
docker cp /root/influxdb {{ addon_xxxxx_influxdbv2 }}:/data/imports # Copy the backup to the v2 container (Make sure it's started)
docker exec -it {{ addon_xxxxx_influxdbv2 }} /bin/bash # Enter the v2 container. Replace addon_xxxxx_influxdbv2 with the v2 Id
influx write \
  --org-id homeassistant \
  --bucket homeassistant \
  --file /data/imports \
  --token {{ TOKEN }} # Replace {{ TOKEN }} with your homeassistant/operator token.
```
